# Consumed by GoReleaser: it copies the already cross-compiled binary out of the
# build context rather than compiling, so the image build is fast and uses the
# same static binary every other artifact ships.
#
# GoReleaser builds one multi-platform image with buildx and stages each
# platform's binary under a $TARGETPLATFORM directory (e.g. linux/amd64/) in the
# build context, so the COPY line selects the right one through the automatic
# TARGETPLATFORM build arg.
